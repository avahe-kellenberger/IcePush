-- Make stuff less static (Particularly stuff in IcePush)
-- FIX MOVEMENT
      Movement was improved alot with the physics updates, but the following problems still exist
       - It is possible for an object moving at a high speed to pass across an object in its path (Requires continuous collision detection)
       - Under some conditions objects can interpenetrate
      _^_ is working on a simple grid based collision system that could fix these (Or at least the second item)
DONE -- Camera got messed up upon reintegration with 3D, the model baseX/Y/Z etc need to be changed on PLAYER_MOVED events
-- GET THAT FUCKING KEYLINIX SHIT FUCKING FIXED RIGHT SO THAT I CAN TYPE MY NAME FAST AND HAVE EVERY LETTER REGISTER
-- More contents ???
-- CREATE INFERFACE EDITOR AND FILEFORMAT
      Interface format created by Tekk
-- SET UP THE SERVER FOR FILE SHARING SO THAT CONTENTS CREATED BY USERS MAY BE PERSISTED AND PROPOGATED
-- ADD PHYSICAL INTERACTIVES, SUCH AS MOMMENTUM; FRICTION; COLLISION COEFFICIENTS ETC
      Current physics system does not model angular momentum and treats all objects as if they are equal in mass
-- The triangle filling function can leave holes between adjacent polygons (Assigned to _^_)
-- The serverside packet handling is vulnerable to packets sent by the client that are smaller than they are supposed to be, potentially resulting in index out of bounds
-- The server is vulnerable to a client connecting and then never writing any data to the socket; the server blocks forever waiting for clienttype/login info
      Trying to make the server ensure that all data is sent before reading it and rejecting the client otherwise causes people on higher latency connections to be locked out
-- Worldserver is a piece of crap
